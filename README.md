# CS474 Reading List Web App

This web app will allow users to add, delete, and edit books to their reading list. The user will be able to add the book title, author, publisher, genre, page count, a short summary, and the users rating. These features will have full CRUD functionality. Within this web app, there will be a sort function and a search function to easily find and customize the users reading list and the items within.

I will be using the Google Books API located here: https://developers.google.com/books

To develop this web app I will be using the MERN tech stack as well as HTML and CSS.
